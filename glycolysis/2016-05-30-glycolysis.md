# TODO:
- Bring up to date with recent code changes

This is the second in a series of tutorials by [Joseph Stahl](https://josephstahl.com/) about [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org).
The [first post]({% post_url 2016-05-24-getting-started %}) covers creating a 2-node graph with Cytoscape.js and is recommended reading for those unfamiliar with the software.

# Getting ready

## A container for the graph: `index.html`
As before, Cytoscape.js requires an area to draw the graph. A simple `index.html` will get us started.
CSS will again be inline with the HTML to keep things simple.
A full-window graph is used to provide the glycolysis graph with as much space as possible for molecule structures. 

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Tutorial 2: Glycolysis</title>
    <script src='cytoscape.js'></script>
</head>

<style>
    #cy {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        position: absolute;
        top: 0px;
        left: 0px;
    }
</style>

<body>
    <div id="cy"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

## A list of elements: `gly_elements.js`
In the interest of keeping different parts of code separate, the steps of glycolysis will be specified in `gly_elements.js` while the graph-related code will be in `glycolysis.js`.
Modify the `<head>` section of `index.html` to include these two files:

```html
<head>
    <title>Tutorial 2: Glycolysis</title>
    <script src='cytoscape.js'></script>
    <script src='gly_elements.js'></script>
    <script src='glycolysis.js'></script>
</head>
```

`gly_elements.js` is a list of the molecules involved in glycolysis.
Because the file is lengthy and repetitive, I will only be including an excerpt in the tutorial; however, the [full source is available for download and review]({{site.baseurl}}/public/demos/glycolysis/gly_elements.js).
Each intermediate metabolite will be a node of the graph.
The enzymes that convert each metabolite to the next intermediate will be the edges connecting nodes.

Nodes have three `data` properties:

- `id`: a unique ID given to the node; in this case, IDs are incrementing integers—good for representing an incremental process such as metabolism.
  Metabolite names are not used here (despite being unique) because they complicate comparison; there's no good way to tell that
  G6P is "greater than" (comes after) glucose without relying on analyzing edges. 
- `molecule`: the name of the metabolite
- `image`: a line-drawing image of the metabolite; displaying these images will be covered later

Edges have four `data` properties:

- `id`: again, IDs are unique incrementing strings, with the exception of `step5-reverse` which is named such to preserve the ordering found on [the Glycolysis Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis)
- `enzyme`: the name of the enzyme involved in each reaction. This will be used to display names on edges
- `source`: in chemistry terms, the reactant
- `target`: in chemistry terms, the product. Edges go from `source` to `target` much as chemical reactions proceed from reactants to products

```javascript
// based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis

var GlyElements = {
  nodes: [
    { data: { id: 0, molecule: 'Glucose', image: 'glucose.svg' } },
    { data: { id: 1, molecule: 'G6P', image: 'g6p.svg' } },
    { data: { id: 2, molecule: 'F6P', image: 'f6p.svg' } },
    { data: { id: 3, molecule: 'F1,6BP', image: 'f16bp.svg' } },
    // GADP & DHAP is in equilibrium
    { data: { id: 4, molecule: 'GADP', image: 'gadp.svg' } },
    { data: { id: 5, molecule: 'DHAP', image: 'dhap.svg' } }, 
    { data: { id: 6, molecule: '1,3BPG', image: '13bpg.svg' } }
    // Remaining data excluded for brevity
  ],
  edges: [
    { data: { id: 'step1', enzyme: 'Hexokinase', source: 0, target: 1 } },
    { data: { id: 'step2', enzyme: 'Phosphoglucose isomerase', source: 1, target: 2 } },
    { data: { id: 'step3', enzyme: 'Phosphofructokinase', source: 2, target: 3 } },
    { data: { id: 'step4', enzyme: 'Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase', source: 3, target: 4 } },
    { data: { id: 'step5', enzyme: 'Triosephosphate isomerase', source: 4, target: 5 } },
    // DHAP is in equilibrium with GADP; only GADP moves pathway forward
    { data: { id: 'step5-reverse', enzyme: 'Triosephosphate isomerase', source: 5, target: 4 } },
    { data: { id: 'step6', enzyme: 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase',
        // 4 is GADP, 5 is DHAP and is therefore skipped over
        source: 4,
        target: 6 } }
    // Remaining data excluded for brevity
  ]
};
```

This will create a variable, `GlyElements`, which is accessible within `glycolysis.js`, saving us the effort of specifying each step as elements when initializing a Cytoscape.js graph.
One can see on [the Wikipedia page for glycolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis) that Step 4 produces a mixture of two products but only GADP moves forward in Step 6.
Because of this, edges are specified manually; connecting each node *i* to *i+1* via a for-loop would not be accurate.

At this point, the workspace should be structured as follows, with `glycolysis.js` currently existing as an empty placeholder file.

```
glycolysis/
    +-- cytoscape.js
    +-- gly_elements.js
    +-- glycolysis.js
    +-- index.html
```

# Making the graph: `glycolysis.js`

## Waiting for `<div>`: Ensuring `cytoscape.js` has a container to use
[Last time]({% post_url 2016-05-24-getting-started %}), it was possible to place `var cy = cytoscape({...})` after the `<div>` element to make sure that the graph had a container to use.
Because of putting `<script src='glycolysis.js'></script>` in `<head>`, ordering will not work this time.
Instead, using an event listener will make sure that no graph-related code is run before the DOM has finished being laid out.
Add `document.addEventListener` to the top of the file, as follows: 

```javscript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() { ... });
```

All remaining code will go inside of the anonymous function (which will be executed once the DOM layout is finished).

## An empty graph
Now that we are sure there is a `<div>` element to draw within, it's time to call `cytoscape()`.

```javascript
  var cy = cytoscape({
    container: document.getElementById('cy'),
    style: [
      {
        selector: 'node',
        style: {
          label: 'data(molecule)'
        }
      }, {
        selector: 'edge',
        style: {
          label: 'data(enzyme)'
        }
      }
    ]
  });
```

Remember that this will all be indented within the function. As done previously, the graph will be created within the `cy` element.
The object passed to `cytoscape()` also contains some style directives for the graph.
In [getting-started]({% post_url 2016-05-24-getting-started %}), the `id` property was used for labels; now, `molecule` will be used to provide more descriptive names.
Edges are given labels in the same manner as nodes: specify that a style is being applied to them via a [selector](http://js.cytoscape.org/#selectors) then provide properties as a `style` object.
Currently, only a `label` style is applied so that viewers of the graph can tell what enzyme is involved in each step.

Unlike the Getting Started example, no elements are specified during initialization of the graph (and consequently no layout, since there are no elements to lay out).
These will be added later by using the `GlyElements` object defined earlier.

## Populating the graph
Due to previously specifying a JSON object (recall `GlyElements`?), adding elements to this graph is extraordinarily easy.
Add the following right underneath `var cy = cytoscape({...})`:

```javascript
  cy.add(GlyElements);
```

Easy, right? Now that elements have been added, it's time to style them. The following code directly follows `cy.add(GlyElements)`.

```javascript
  cy.nodes().forEach(function(ele) {
    cy.style().selector('#' + ele.id())
      .style({
        'width': 200,
        'height': 200,
        'background-opacity': 0,
        'background-image': 'assets/' + ele.data().image,
        'background-fit': 'contain',
        'background-clip': 'none'
      })
      .update();
  });
```

[`cy.nodes().forEach(function);`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#eles.forEach) will apply a function to each node of the graph—useful since we have to modify each node's `background-image` property, among others.
`cy.nodes()` is a quick way to get an array of all nodes of the graph.
`forEach()` provides `ele`, `i`, and `eles` to the passed function. In this case, only `ele` is used because styling is node-specific and does not require knowledge of the index of the node (`i`) or information about the other nodes (`eles`).

`forEach()` is passed an anonymous function which will modify the style of each element.
The function is a long chain of function calls which select nodes, modify their style, and update the graph with the newly styled nodes.
[`cy.style()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#cy.style) returns a style object for the entire graph.
Since only the style of a single node will be modified at a time, a [selector](http://js.cytoscape.org/#selectors) call is chained next.
Selectors use a [CSS-esque string for selecting elements, detailed in the Cytoscape.js documentation](http://js.cytoscape.org/#selectors/notes-amp-caveats).
`'#' + ele.id()` will select individual elements to ensure that an image is only applied to that element.
The [`'#'` character](http://js.cytoscape.org/#selectors/group-class-amp-id) tells the `selector()` function that it will be matching elements based on ID.
String concatenation is used to join `'#'` with `ele.id()` (recall that `ele` is passed to this function via `forEach()`) to form the completed selector string.

At this point, the graph's style object has been narrowed down to the style referring to a single element.
Now it is time to modify that style.
`style()` is again called, this time to get the style of the single object provided by the selector.
Unlike last time, a new style is provided via the object passed to `style()`.

- [`'width'` and `'height'`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#style/node-body) properties make each node 200px wide—large enough to hold the images.
- [`'background-opacity'`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#style/node-body) makes the back of the node transparent instead of the usual gray color.
- [`'background-image'`, `'background-fit'`, and `'background-clip'`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#style/background-image) all refer to the background images being used (the metabolite SVGs).
  - `'background-image': 'assets/' + ele.data().image` concatenates `assets/` (the folder where the SVG images are stored) with the image filename previously specified in `gly_elements.js`.
  [ele.data()](http://js.cytoscape.org/#eles.data) provides an easy way to access the data of an element; in this case, the `image` value is retrieved.
  - `'background-fit: 'contain'` shrinks the images as needed to fit within the 200px nodes
  - `'background-clip': 'none'` ensures that images that square images within round nodes are not cropped. Alternatively, node shaped could be changed to `square` when initializing the graph.

Finally, a call to `update()` is made to complete applying the new style to each element.

*Note: styling the elements requires adding SVG elements which for this tutorial are written as relative URLs.
To view images, you will likely need to point a webserver at the `glycolysis` directory (or whichever directory contains your work for this tutorial).
Alternatively, you may change `'background-image': 'assets/' + ele.data().image'` to `'background-image': 'http://blog.js.cytoscape.org/public/demos/glycolysis/assets/' + ele.data().image` to use the SVGs hosted on Github Pages.*

If using images stored locally, [download the SVGs here]({{site.baseurl}}/public/demos/glycolysis/assets/assets.zip).
Unzip and make sure that your workspace is organized as follows: 

```
glycolysis/
    +-- assets/
    |   +-- 13bpg.svg
    |   +-- 2pg.svg
    |   +-- 3pg.svg
    |   +-- dhap.svg
    |   +-- f16bp.svg
    |   +-- f6p.svg
    |   +-- g6p.svg
    |   +-- gadp.svg
    |   +-- glucose.svg
    |   +-- pep.svg
    |   +-- pyruvate.svg
    +-- cytoscape.js
    +-- gly_elements.js
    +-- glycolysis.js
    +-- index.html
```

## Laying out the graph
Now that all nodes are added and have images, it's time to lay out the graph.
Order is important here to make sure that all intermediate metabolites are laid out in the right order.

We'll start with a [`grid` layout](http://js.cytoscape.org/#layouts/grid).

```javascript
 cy.layout({
    name: 'grid'
 });
```
 
However, at this point the graph looks crowded and hard to read.
Some other options should be specified to get a better looking layout.

```javascript
  cy.layout({
    name: 'grid',
    fit: false,
    columns: 1,
    avoidOverlap: true,
    avoidOverlapPadding: 80
  });
```

This will produce a better looking graph where all the intermediates are lined up vertically with enough padding between nodes to read enzyme names on the edges.

- `fit: false` stops Cytoscape.js from trying to fit the entire graph on one screen. With the molecule images, it's best to keep them large and well-spaced and scroll down if necessary.
- `columns: 1` lines all elements up vertically. This will be useful later when scrolling the viewport.
- `avoidOverlap: true` prevents images from overlapping and allows us to use `avoidOverlapPadding`
- `avoidOverlapPadding: 80` puts 80 pixels between each node, giving enough space to read the enzyme names depicted on edges

There is still one problem though: DHAP is not put in the proper location.
Since only one column is available to Cytoscape.js, it places DHAP underneath GADP which results in the edge from GADP going underneath DHAP to get to 1,3BPG.
To fix this, we'll create two columns in the graph but place everything except DHAP in the left-hand column.
This way, DHAP will stick out to the right, making it easy to recognize that DHAP is in equilibrium with GADP and not a predecessor of 1,3BPG.

To create this layout, modify the object passed to `cy.layout()` slightly.

```javascript
  cy.layout({
    name: 'grid',
    fit: false, // it's okay if some of the graph is hidden off-screen because viewport scrolls
    columns: 2,
    avoidOverlap: true,
    avoidOverlapPadding: 80,
    position: function(ele) {
      if (ele.data().molecule === 'DHAP') {
        // DHAP is, as usual, a special case
        return { row: ele.id(), col: 1 }; // layout to right of GADP
      }
      return { row: ele.id(), col: 0 };
    }
  });
```

As noted previously, `columns` has been bumped up to 2.
Additionally, the `position` property is now specified.
The value of `position` is a function which returns a `{ row: x, col: y}` type object, where `x` and `y` are grid coordinates for the object.
The most straightforward way to handle DHAP is to examine the name of the molecule currently being laid out.
This is retrieved the same way as the image filename, with `ele.data().molecule`.
If the node's molecule name is 'DHAP', it's put in the second column; otherwise, the first column.
All nodes are put in rows matching their ID—another advantage to using incrementing integers for IDs.

Finally, let's [lock the elements](http://js.cytoscape.org/#nodes.lock) to make sure that users don't mess up our careful layout!

```javascript
  cy.nodes().lock();
```

This will lock the graph in the current layout, preventing users from dragging nodes around (but not from scrolling the viewpoint).

**Congratulations, you've made a glycolysis graph! It should look similar to this:**

![Graph before adding animation button]({{site.baseurl}}/public/demos/glycolysis/assets/graph_before_button.png)

# Animation

Now that the graph has been created and filled, it's time to add some animation.
After the graph is loaded, the viewport will zoom in to the first element (glucose).
Then, each time a "Next Step" button is clicked, the graph will scroll to focus on the next element.

The process of animating the graph is broken down into several steps:

1. Focusing on the first element of the graph after loading
2. Creating an advanceViewport function to find the next element and focus on it
  - Another function will be uesd for finding the next element
  - The function created in Step 1 (for focusing on an element) can be reused for focusing on the next element
3. Adding a button to the graph which will execute the advanceViewport function

## Focusing on the first element

First of all, a function must be written that can focus on an element passed to it.
We'll call it `panIn(target)`, where `target` is a Cytoscape.js element. 
`function panIn(target) {...}` should be placed right after `cy.nodes().lock()`, within the Event Listener function. 

```javascript
  function panIn(target) {
    cy.animate({
      fit: {
        eles: target,
        padding: 40
      },
      duration: 700,
      easing: 'linear',
      queue: true
    });
  }
```

[`cy.animate({...})`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#cy.animate) is a Cytoscape.js function which animates a change in the viewport.
Its net effect is a combination of [`cy.animation({...})`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#cy.animation) and [`ani.play()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#ani.play) which will create an animation on a viewport and run that animation, respectively.
`cy.animate()` is a viewport animation, meaning that it changes the view of the graph without moving any elements around.
I've specified the options necessary for this tutorial but more options [are documented with `cy.animate()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#cy.animate).

- `fit:`
  - `eles: target` will focus the viewport around `target`. `target` is initially the first element (glucose) but will change as the user advances the view with the "Next Step" button.
  - `padding: 40` adds white space around `target` to help things look less crowded
- `duration: 700` tells Cytoscape.js to draw the animation out for 700ms (so that enzyme text may be read)
- `easing: 'linear'` causes the animation to proceed at a steady rate instead of speeding up initially then slowing down (`linear` is the default if `easing` is unspecified)
- `queue: true` will queue up animations so that successive clicks of "Next Step" will advance the graph several steps.

Now that a function which can animate viewport changes has been created, it's time to put it to use.
To start, we'll focus on the first element of the graph after loading (instead of displaying several elements).

```javascript
  var startNode = cy.$('node[molecule = "Glucose"]');
```

This function should be placed after `panIn(target)`, i.e. the last statement in the function given to the Event Listener.
[`cy.$(selector)`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#cy.$) is a quick way to get all elements from the graph that match a selector (it is simply an alias to `cy.filter()`).
As with previous selectors, the selector is a specially formatted string.
The first part, `node`, will select all nodes in the graph (this could also be done with `cy.nodes()`, which also acceptors a selector to filter nodes).
The second part, `[molecule = "Glucose"]`, selects only the glucose node so that the graph is focused on a single node.
[Square brakets](http://js.cytoscape.org/#selectors/data) are used in selectors to perform matching against data attributes.
In this case, we are matching against the `molecule` attribute that was defined in `gly_elements.js` and is being used as node labels.
Because the matching is against a string, `"Glucose"` must be enclosed in double quotes.

Once the initial node has been found, zooming in on it is easy.

```javascript
  panIn(startNode);
```

This will call `panIn(target)` with `startNode` (glucose) as the target.
If you reload `index.html`, the graph should now focus on only the first element (glucose) instead of all elements.

## Writing `advanceViewport()`

Cytoscape.js has a special query, `':selected'`, which we will use to our advance to advance the viewport.
This affords more flexibility than storing the node in a `currentView` variable, which would not allow users to click on different parts of the graph and animate from there.
To start out, it's important to select the first node (glucose). Modify the previous code to insert a call to `cy.select()`:

```javascript
  var startNode = cy.$('node[molecule = "Glucose"]');
  startNode.select();
  panIn(startNode);
```

[`eles.select()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#eles.select) will mark whichever node(s) it is called on as selected.
In this case, only a single node (the glucose node) is selected. 

Now that the starting node is selected, it's time to write the `advanceViewport()` function.
Add it immediately after `panIn(target)`.

```javascript
  function advanceViewport() {
    var oldSelect = cy.$(':selected');
    oldSelect.unselect();
    var nextSelect = findSuccessor(oldSelect);
    nextSelect.select();
    panIn(nextSelect);
  }
```

`findSuccessor(oldSelect)` will be covered soon.
The `':selected'` selector string comes in handy here, since the selected node can be found even if it has changed (via user interaction) since the last call to `advanceViewport()`.
`oldSelect.unselect()` will [unselect](http://js.cytoscape.org/#eles.unselect) the selected node so that only one element (the successor) is selected at a time.
`var nextSelect = findSuccessor(oldSelect)` finds the next element from `oldSelect`.
Because some special treatment is required for DHAP (to avoid getting stuck in a loop), I chose to break `findSuccessor` out into its own function.
Finally, the next element is selected and the animation is run, reusing the `panIn(target)` function previously defined.

## Writing `findSuccessor(selected)`
As usual, the edge case of DHAP makes things more complicated.
Normally, the successor is whichever node has the highest ID relative to the current node.
This will work for normally advancing through the graph because GADP (with id = 4) will have two successors, but the "correct" successor is 1,3BPG (id = 6) which will be chosen rather than DHAP (id = 5) after comparing IDs.
However, this approach must be modified since users are allowed to select their own elements. If a user selects DHAP, its only successor is GADP but DHAP has a higher ID than GADP.
Additionally, there is no guarantee that `selected` will be a node. If a user has selected an edge, then the behavior for finding connected nodes will change.

```javascript
  function findSuccessor(selected) {
    var connectedNodes;
    if (selected.isEdge()) {
      connectedNodes = selected.target();
    } else {
      connectedNodes = selected.connectedEdges().targets();
      connectedNodes = connectedNodes.difference(selected);
    }
    var successor = connectedNodes.max(function(ele) {
      return Number(ele.id());
    });
    return successor.ele;
  }
```  

First, `var connectedNodes` is declared. `connectedNodes` is then modified in the `if/else` block.
The `if/else` block handles cases where the user has manually selected an edge instead of the nodes that are normally selected.
If an edge is selected, [`selected.target()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#edge.target) returns its target, paying attention to edge direction.
If edge direction is unimportant, [`selected.connectedNodes()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#edges.connectedNodes) may be used, which will return both the source and target.
When a node is selected, `selected.connectedEdges().targets()` is used, which combines [`connectedEdges()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#nodes.connectedEdges) with [`targets()`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#edges.targets) to find all targets of the selected node.
Then, [`difference(selected)`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#eles.difference) is called on `connectedNodes` to make sure that the currently selected node does not end up in the new collection.
This is necessary for handling DHAP, which is put into the `connectedNodes` collection when it is selected (because `connectedEdges()` includes the edge from GADP with DHAP as a target). 
Usually `connectedNodes` is just one target, except for GADP which has two targets (DHAP and 1,3BPG).
In the case of two targets, the successor is defined to be the one with the highest ID.

```javascript
    var successor = connectedNodes.max(function(ele) {
      return Number(ele.id());
    });
```

[`connectedNodes.max(function)`](http://js.cytoscape.org/#eles.max) takes a function as an argument and will return an object (`{ value, ele }`) that corresponds to the largest element.
Any property of an element can be compared by `max()` via the function provided to `max()` which will return a specified property of `ele` for comparison.
Like `forEach()`, `max()` will provide several parameters (`ele`, `i`, and `eles`) to the provided function but we will only be using `ele`.

The call to `ele.id()` is wrapped with `Number()` here to ensure that integer comparison is done rather than string comparison.
Once `max()` has finished, the `ele` property of `successor` is returned and will be the next node the animation focuses on with `panIn(nextSelect)`.


## Adding a "Next Step" button
Now that all the animation mechanics are taken care of, it's important to add a way to use these animations!
Adding an animation button will be done by modifying the DOM within `glycolysis.js`.
But first, let's give the button a style: medium sized, in the top right.
Reopen `index.html` and add the following CSS style within the `<style>` tag, right after `#cy`.

```html
    #advance {
        width: 20%;
        height: 10%;
        position: absolute;
        top: 5%;
        right: 5%;
    }
```

Now return to `glycolysis.js`. In the interest of keeping things tidy, we'll create a function which returns a button we can append to the document.

```javascript
  function makeAdvanceButton() {
    var advanceButton = document.createElement('input');
    advanceButton.type = 'button';
    advanceButton.id = 'advance';
    advanceButton.value = "Next Step";
    advanceButton.onclick = advanceViewport;
    return advanceButton;
  }
```

Again, this function goes inside the function being passed to `addEventListener()`.
After creating the `'input'` element, a few properties are modified: 

- `advanceButton.type = 'button'` marks the element as a button instead of another input such as a form
- `advanceButton.id = 'advance'` will apply the CSS style previously defined in `index.html`
- `advanceButton.value = "Next Step"` gives the input button a label so users know what id does
- `advanceButton.onclick = advanceViewport` assigns an action to the button. In this case, when the button is clicked, the `advanceViewport()` function will run.

Finally, the button is returned with `return advanceButton`. To add the newly created button to the webpage, place the following at the very bottom of the function given to `addEventListener()`:

```javascript
  document.body.appendChild(makeAdvanceButton());
```

This is a bit of DOM manipulation to add the newly created button to the webpage.
This is done within `glycolysis.js` instead of simply adding a `<input>` tag to `index.html` because `advanceViewport()` is within `glycolysis.js`. 


# Improving the graph

## Looping back to the beginning
Currently, the graph will reach pyruvate and the "Next Step" button will lose its effect (since pyruvate is the final metabolite and has no successor).
One possibility is adding an edge back from pyruvate to glucose but this reduces accuracy of the graph—glucose cannot be produced from pyruvate.
Instead, we'll modify `advanceViewport()` to recognize when it is at the last element and loop back to the beginning.
`oldSelect` and `nextSelect` will refer to the same element when the graph has reached pyruvate, so comparing them will allow us to recognize this and return to the beginning.

```javascript
  function advanceViewport() {
    var oldSelect = cy.$(':selected');
    oldSelect.unselect();
    var nextSelect = findSuccessor(oldSelect);
    if (oldSelect.id() === cy.$('#10').id()) {
      // loop back to beginning instead of repeating pyruvate
      nextSelect = cy.$('#0');
    }
    nextSelect.select();
    panIn(nextSelect);
  }
```

The ID of `oldSelect` is compared with the ID of pyruvate and if equal, `nextSelect` is changed to the first element of the graph, glucose.
These steps are easily accomplished with `cy.$('#0')`, another [selector which matches against element IDs](http://js.cytoscape.org/#selectors/group-class-amp-id).

# Conclusion
Now you should have a fully working glycolysis graph, looking similar to this:
