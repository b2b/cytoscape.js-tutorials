# Introduction

This post is the final part of a series of Cytoscape.js tutorials written by [Joseph Stahl](josephstahl.com) for Google Summer of Code 2016.

In this tutorial, we'll be using [Cordova](PUT LINK HERE) and [Cytoscape.js](js.cytoscape.org) to create a mobile app which can create a graph of Wikipedia pages, with each page a node and links between pages as edges.

# Setup

## Cordova

First, we'll need to install Cordova globally with `npm install cordova@6.3 -g`.
Using version 6.3 ensures compatibility with this tutorial.
Now that Cordova is installed, we can use it to take care of creating the directory for our app.

*Note: it's best to provide your own reverse domain name here because signing applications for testing on iOS requires a unique RDN*.
Run `cordova create cordovacy com.madeUpReverseDomain.cordovacy cordovacy` to create a new directory called `cordovacy`, containing an application named `cordovacy` and the provided reverse-domain-name.
With this done, `cd` into the new directory.

## package.json

As before, we'll use [npm](PUT LINK HERE) to install parts of our application.
However, we'll only be using npm for Cordova this time; the rest of the application will use a separate package manager, [Bower](PUT LINK HERE), to manage dependencies and take a setup out of building the application each time—we won't have to run [Browserify](PUT LINK HERE).
Create a `package.json` file (`npm init` can automate this) and the following dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "cordova-cy",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "echo \"cordova app\"",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "cordova run browser"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "bower": "^1.7.9",
    "cordova": "^6.3.0"
  }
}
```

You may wish to install Bower globally to make calling it easier—you'll be able to use `$ bower` instead of `$ node_modules/.bin/bower`.
If you choose to not to install Bower and Cordova globally, prefix any later commands I use with `node_modules/bin`.
Run `npm install` to install Bower.

## bower.json

Now that Bower is installed, we can install the front-end files—CSS and JavaScript—that our application will depend on.
Similar to `package.json`, create a `bower.json` file by running `bower init` and answering the questions.
Once this is done, we'll install the necessary files, saving them as we go: `bower install cytoscape skeleton font-awesome jquery#2.2.4 cytoscape-qtip qtip2#2.2.1 --save`.

By default, Bower will place downloaded files in `bower_components/` so to add them to the project, we'll need to copy them to Cordova's `www/` directory (created during `cordova create`).

Copy the following files from their various folders in `bower_components/`, placing them in the proper location inside `www/` (`js` for JavaScript files; `css` for style sheets): 

```
+-- js/
  +-- cytoscape.js
  +-- cytoscape-qtip.js
  +-- jquery.js
  +-- jquery.qtip.min.js
+-- css/
  +-- font-awesome.css
  +-- jquery.qtip.min.css
  +-- normalize.css
  +-- skeleton.css
+-- fonts/
  +-- FontAwesome.otf
  +-- fontawesome-webfont.* (all fontawesome-webfont files)
```

# Cordova preparation

We'll need to modify the default files generated by `cordova create` before we can use them.
Most of these changes are related to us not using a framework such as Angular.js; because of this, many files can be simplified.

## config.xml

We'll have to modify `config.xml` slightly, primarily to update app variables (such as name and developer) but also to change app behavior slightly.
Because we're writing our app as a webpage, mobile platforms may default to "bouncing" the web page if scrolled around, which is undesirable for an app that is supposed to act native.
To fix this, insert `<preference name="DisallowOverscroll" value="true" />` immediately above the last line of the file (so that it's within the `<widget>` block).
While the file's open, modify the description and author properties as you see fit.

## index.html

We'll make many more changes to `index.html` later but for now, just insert the following line at the beginning of `<head>`:

```html
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src * blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self' https://*.wikipedia.org 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'">
```

This is **not** a safe Content Security Policy for a published application (notice how it loads almost anything) but is suitable for a demonstration application where ease-of-development is important.
Note the inclusion of *.wikipedia.org as a script source; we'll be using [JSONP](PUT LINK HERE) for issuing API requests; running the JavaScript returned by Wikipedia requires us to list it as a safe source.

# Big changes to index.html

## head

Now that we've made Cordova's security policy more permissive, we'll move on to adding our own code.
Modify `<head>` to look like the following:

```html
<head>
    <!-- This policy allows everything (eg CSS, AJAX, object, frame, media, etc) except that 
      * CSS only from the same origin and inline styles,
      * scripts only from the same origin and inline styles, and eval(). And wikipedia, for JSONP
    -->
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src * blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self' https://*.wikipedia.org 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'">

  <meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no">
  <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight" content="no">
  <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, width=device-width">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/normalize.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/skeleton.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/font-awesome.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/jquery.qtip.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/index.css">
  <title>Wikipedia Graph</title>
</head>
```

In addition to the previously mentioned security policy, you can see that we've updated the title and added a number of our own CSS files.

## body

We'll be making so many changes to `<body>` that it's probably easiest to delete all existing code and start from scratch.

```html
<body>
  <div id="deviceready">
    <div class="event listening">
      <i class="fa fa-refresh fa-spin"></i>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- input area -->
    <h1>Tutorial 5</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <input type="text" class="u-full-width" id="pageTitle" placeholder="Wikipedia starting page">
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <input type="button" class="button-primary u-full-width" id="submitButton" value="Start graph" type="submit">
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <input type="button" class="button-primary u-full-width" id="redoLayoutButton" value="Redo layout" type="submit">
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- graph area -->
    <div id="cy"></div>
  </div>

  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/cytoscape.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.qtip.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/cytoscape-qtip.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/graph.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</body>
```
