- TEST ON DEVICES!
- Animate layout changes to transition is less jarring
- Is there a race condition happening between `window.cy.resize().center()` in `index.js` and `cy.layout()` in `graph.js`?
  - Behavior seems correct but I think it might be possible that `cy.layout()` could be called before `window.cy.resize().center`
  - Would this matter? Regardless of whether graph is laid out, then viewport is centered on graph OR viewport is centered, and graph layout occurs with newly centered viewport?
