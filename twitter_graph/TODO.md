# NOTES
- Or look at using Heroku for using API with JS. But start with static data and write program for downloading data later.
  - "Centrality" measurement for the graph. Or degree. Mapper for size of node based on degree. Degree is a cy function. Try color or border to correlate with number of tweets.
- Feature set: emphasize layout. At least two layout options for user to choose:
  - Concentric (circle) AND physics simulation (force directed like cose or cola)
  - Look at Qtip extension for putting in additional statistics about nodes/ edges. Ex: link to their twitter profile.

# QUESTIONS
- In my tutorial I'm currently leaving in some error handling code (relating to HTTP status codes) but not spending much time explaining the details (because errors shouldn't occur on cached data). Should I keep this or remove it?
