- Add Qtip extension
- Get followers of followers to make force-directred more interesting (will there be cliques?)
- Use Express API instead of already downloaded files (will this be too slow?)
  - Don't do until done with other steps; otherwise, API calls will be rate-limited as I test
  - Could load using JQuery now that I am using it for Qtip
    - And use a Promise (see Wine and Cheese demo) to wait to add followers until main user loaded
- Performance?
  - Rewrite using the JQuery method of waiting on DOM instead of DOMContentLoaded event
