# Installing

Need to have Python2 and MSVC 2015 installed before `npm install` (which will install nodegit).

(MSVC is in Visual Studio, enable C++ tools)


# Future ideas

- Git history graph with Cytoscape, similar to [https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/blob/master/examples/walk-history.js](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/blob/master/examples/walk-history.js).
