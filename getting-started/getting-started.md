# Coding starts May 22!

## List format as I write

- Create folder for new Cytoscape.js project. I am using `getting-started/`.
- [Download Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org)
    - Unzip the folder and move `cytoscape.js` to your project folder.
- Create an `index.html` file and add Cytoscape.js.
```html
<!doctype html>
<script src="cytoscape.js"></script>
```


# TODO:
- Why it's necessary to put the div element before the script (so that the container is initialized when script runs)
- Explain the use of the #cy element for styling
- Adding styling to Cytoscape.js graph
- Change view size? Might want to take up whole window.
- Displaying labels on nodes and edges
- More to come :)
